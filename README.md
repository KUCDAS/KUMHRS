# KUCDAS - Ko√ß University Central Doctor Appointment System

## Description

KUCDAS is a medical appointment website developed as a group project for COMP306 to enhance Database Management skills. This platform facilitates the management of medical appointments, prescriptions, and user statistics in a streamlined and efficient manner.

## Note

- **Educational Purpose:** This website has been developed solely for educational purposes within the framework of a COMP306 course project and is not intended for commercial use.
- **UI Design:** The main page UI (main.php) is inspired by and closely resembles the design found on [MHRS www.mhrs.gov.tr](http://www.mhrs.gov.tr). All other features, including additional UI elements and database queries, have been independently developed by our team.
- **Imaginary Data:** All names of patients and doctors are fictitiously generated. Any resemblance to real persons, living or dead, is purely coincidental and unintentional.
- **Hospital Names:** The names of hospitals used within this project are either entirely fictional or are actual institutions, mentioned purely for the purposes of context within the educational scope of the project.


## Features

- **User Authentication:** Separate login portals for general users and doctors.
- **Account Registration:** Distinct signup processes tailored for general users and doctors.
- **Appointment Management:** Book appointments with specific doctors and view your upcoming appointments.
